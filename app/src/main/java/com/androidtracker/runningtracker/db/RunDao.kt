/*
Dao -> Data access Object it's just an interface which describe all the possible action's we had to
do with our database

insert & delete -> should be suspend as we had to do the task in the bg
getAllRunsSortedByDate -> as we just had to observe the data here so that's why it's not in suspend
Order by -> we are sorting the data by time wise
Desc(descending) -> latest run should be on the top of the list

Note :- here we created different - different function so to sort easily.
